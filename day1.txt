Day 1
------

	Introduction to Java
	Features of Java
	Your First Java code
	Compiling the code
	Running the Code
	Simple Classes and Object

	Java Standard Edition
	
	Java Features
	--------------
	1. Simple 
		no need to know the h/w (hardware details) 
		no pointers 
		no memory management

	2. WORA
		- write once run anywhere
		platform neutral

	3. Multithreaded

		
	4. Robust
		- excpetion handling - ability to handle runtime errors
		- automatic garbage collection

	5. Distributed
		- write programs for the network
			programA on  machine1
			other programB on another machine2

			and programA and programB can communicate
			with each other over the network

	6. Object Oriented
		KEY FEATURE
		(all our 60 hours are around this feature)

		What is an object?

		
		Object = physical state + behaviour
			 ( data )       + functionality


		cat  = color, age   +  sleeping()
			weight		snoozing()
			breed		drinkMilk()
					chaseMice()



		account = ac_type, ac_no + withdraw()
			  ac_balance	   deposit()
			  ac_holder_name   transfer()
			  acholder_phone   getbalance()
			  		   printStatement()




		


	1 listening + 2 speaking (chatting)

	3 read the code
	
	4 write the code


Your First Java Code
----------------------

the code name can be any name
extension would be .java

The fundamental unit of JAVA programming is a class







STEP I : write your code

First.java
-----------
1 public class First
2 { 
3	public static void main(String args[])
4	{
5		System.out.println("Hello everyone");
6	}  
7 } 

line number 3 is a ready made line known to JAVA

STEP II : compile your code

	javac First.java
	|
	it will generate one code known as
	|
	First.class

STEP III : run your code

	java First

	What is a class?		What is an object?

	blueprint of the house		actual house1
					another house2
					third house3
					...
					..as many you want

	design of your object		instance of the class

	class Car
	{
	   numberPlate
	   color
	   cost
	   numberOfSeats
	   engineCC
	   fuelType

		drive() { }
		reverseDrive() { }
		changeGear() { }
		accelerate() { }
		turnRight() { }
		turnLeft() { }
		lockDoor() { }
		unLockDoor() { }
	}

				Car myCarObj1 = new Car();
				Car myCarObj2 = new Car();		
				Car myCarObj3 = new Car();

	blue print of a car		actual car in the memory



Day 2
---------

	1. data types
	2. four types of basic functions
	
	3. integrate data types + these functions together
	using a class

	4. constructor function - prime

	

		Java Data Types
			|
	-----------------------------------
	|	|	|	  |	  |
   integral  floating  character boolean  String
	|	|
  --------	------
  |		|     |
  |		float double
  |		4     8
  |
  byte  1 = 8 bits = 256 possibilities
  short 2 = 16 bits = ...
  int   4 = 32 bits = ..
  long  8 = 64 bits = ...


	byte rollNumber = 10 <-- it occupies only 1 byte

	and in 1 byte to can store a range of

		-128 to 127 
		-    to +
	smallest	largest
	







	byte = how many bits = 8 bits


	1 bit = binary digit

	1 bit can be either off or on
			    0   or 1


	1 bit =		0
			1

	2 bits	= 	0 0 
			0 1
			1 0
			1 1

	2 friends = 	0 0
			1 0
			0 1
			1 1

	3 friends =	0 0 0		1 
			0 0 1		2
			0 1 0		3
			0 1 1		4
			1 0 0		5
			1 1 0		6
			1 0 1		7
			1 1 1 		8

	8 friends	= 256 possibilities

	


		
	because of the space they occupy!!!


	byte occupies 1 byte
	short = 2 bytes

	int = 4 

	long = 8


	long nurseryRollNumber = 50;
	|
	why to spend 8 bytes if this is always max as 50

	

---------------------------


A function
	
	void functionName()
	{
		code here
		to perform		
		some job
	}

Four types of functions

1. function without argument and without return value

	void someThingToBeDone() 
	{

	}

2. function with arguments and without return value

	void multiplyThem(int a, int b)
	{
		int c = a * b;
		System.out.println("product is :"+c);
	}
3. function with arguments and with return value

	float divideThem(int a, int b)
	{
		float c = a / b;
		return c;
	}

4. function without argument but with return value

	float divideThem()
	{
		float c = 100/5;
		return c;
	}
